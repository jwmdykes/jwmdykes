## Thanks for visiting my profile ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is John and I'm a full stack web and AI developer. The tech stack I like to use for building things is React and tailwind for the frontend, PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for my database, and either Deno edge functions or Fastify for backend servers.

#### Current interests

I'm working on an app to help with comic translation (including manga, manhua, webtoon, etc.). The idea is to improve productivity of comic translators by providing them with an easy-to-use UI and AI tools to speed up the translation process.
