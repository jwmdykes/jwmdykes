## Thanks for visiting my profile ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is John and I'm a mathematician/cryptographer with an interest in web development and machine learning. The tech stack I like to use for building things is React and tailwind for the frontend, and Supabase and fastify for my backend/database needs.

#### Current interests

I'm currently working on an app to help with comic translation (including manga, manhua, webtoon, etc.). The idea is to improve productivity of comic translators by providing them with an easy-to-use UI and AI tools to speed up the translation process.
